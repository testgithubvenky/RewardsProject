#  Rewards Program API

This is a Spring Boot-based RESTful API for a customer rewards program. It tracks customer transactions and calculates reward points based on transaction amounts. The system provides endpoints to retrieve transaction history and reward points for individual customers.

##  Features

- Retrieve all customer transactions
- Filter transactions by customer and month
- View recent transactions (last 3 months)
- Calculate and summarize reward points per customer

##  Project Structure

- **Controller**: `RewardsController` — Handles HTTP requests and maps them to service methods.
- **Service**: `RewardService` — Contains business logic for transaction retrieval and reward calculation.
- **DTO**: `RewardSummaryDTO` — Data Transfer Object for reward summaries.
- **Model**: `Transaction` — Represents a customer transaction.
- **Repository**: `TransactionRepository` — Interface for database operations (assumed to be a Spring Data JPA repository).

##  Reward Calculation Logic

Reward points are calculated based on the amount spent in a transaction. Typically, the rules might be:

- 2 points for every dollar spent over $100
- 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 up to $100

##  API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
